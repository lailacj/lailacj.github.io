My name is Laila Johnston (she/her). I am an undergraduate at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCF), where I major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Philosophy. Since August 2021, I have been working in the [CoCoSci Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}  with [Max Siegel](http://web.mit.edu/maxs/www/){:target="_blank"}, [Tobi Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"}, and [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"} researching how to create probabilistic programs that can reason with compositional concepts. Before that, I worked with [David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} researching individual differences in causal learning and building models of causal inference learning ([see our cogsci paper!](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_causallearning_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. I am fasinated by how the human mind forms new concepts and how symbols form meaning. Ultimately, I would like to work towards understanding the structure of human thought by discovering unified theories of intelligence and creating computational models of the human mind.

I am motivated to obtain a PhD not only to further our understanding of the human mind, but also to encourage other first-generation, Hispanic female students to pursue careers in STEM. My experience as a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnair.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the mentorship I have received, has inspired me to reinvest into my community through being the President of the Cognitive Sciences Club and Vice President of AI@UCF. As a leader in these clubs, I strive to create a space where other young scientists, no matter their background, can feel encouraged and supported to fulfill their aspirations.

On my free time, I enjoy running, [hiking/backpacking](https://lailacj.github.io/blog/hikes/), and film photography. I also enjoy spending too much money on vinyl and buying more books than I could ever read.
