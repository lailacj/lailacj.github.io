My name is Laila Johnston (she/her). I am an undergraduate at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCF), where I major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Philosophy. Recently, I was awarded the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}. Since August 2021, I have been working in the [CoCoSci Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}  with [Max Siegel](http://web.mit.edu/maxs/www/){:target="_blank"}, [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"}, and [Tobi Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"} researching how to create probabilistic programs that can reason with compositional concepts. Before that, I worked with [David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} researching individual differences in causal learning and building models of causal inference learning ([see our cogsci paper!](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_causallearning_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Recently, I have been very interested in the computational mechanisms of human question asking. How can we create computational models that form questions as flexibly and easily as humans do? And can questions provide insights into how humans change their world models? Ultimately, I would like to discover the formal computational principles that underpin how the human mind forms new thoughts and concepts. 

<!-- I would like to work towards discovering unified theories of intelligence to create computational models that think and learn the way humans do.  -->

I am motivated to obtain a PhD not only to further our understanding of the human mind, but also to encourage other first-generation, Hispanic female students to pursue careers in STEM. My experience as a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnair.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the mentorship I have received, has inspired me to reinvest into my community through holding executive positions in the AI Club (AI@UCF) and Cognitive Sciences Club at UCF. As a leader in these clubs, I strive to create a space where other young scientists, no matter their background, can feel encouraged and supported to fulfill their aspirations.

On my free time, I enjoy running, [hiking/backpacking](https://lailacj.github.io/blog/hikes/), film photography, and going to jazz concerts. I also enjoy spending too much money on vinyl and buying more books than I could ever read.
