My name is Laila Johnston (she/her). I am an undergrad at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Philosophy. Currently, I work in the [CoCoSci](http://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} group at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} with [Max Siegel](http://web.mit.edu/maxs/www/){:target="_blank"}, [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"}, and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I worked with [Daivd Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} researching individual differences in causal learning and building models of causal inference learning.

I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

On my free time, I enjoy running, hiking, backpacking, and film photography. I also enjoy spending too much money on vinyl, cds, cassettes, and books.
