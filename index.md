My name is Laila Johnston (she/her). I am an undergraduate at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Philosophy. Currently, I am a Visiting Student at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I work in the [CoCoSci Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} with [Max Siegel](http://web.mit.edu/maxs/www/){:target="_blank"}, [Tobi Gerstenberg](http://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"}, and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"} researching how to create probabilistic models that can reason with compositional concepts. Before that, I worked with [David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} researching individual differences in causal learning and building models of causal inference learning ([see our cogsci paper!](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_causallearning_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

Broadly, I am interested in conducting research at the intersection of philosophy, cognitive science, and computer science. More specifically, I am interested in compositional concepts, how the human mind forms new thoughts and concepts, and how this can be represented computationally. 

<!-- I would like to try to discover uniform, formal principles that underlie human thought and intelligence. -->

I'm so grateful for the mentorship and guidence I have received from my research advisors and everyone at the [AAP Office](https://academicsuccess.ucf.edu/aap/){:target="_blank"} at UCF. Having a supportive environment inspires me to reinvest into my community through being the President of the Cognitive Sciences Club at UCF and Vice President of AI@UCF. As a leader in these clubs, a first generation college student, and a Hispanic woman, I strive to create a space where other young scientists, no matter their background, can feel encouraged and supported to fulfill their aspirations.

On my free time, I enjoy running, [hiking/backpacking](https://lailacj.github.io/blog/hikes/), and film photography. I also enjoy spending too much money on vinyl and books.
