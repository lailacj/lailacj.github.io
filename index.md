My name is Laila Johnston (she/her). I am a [Cognitive Science PhD](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/home){:target="_blank"} Student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/){:target="_blank"} primarily advised by [Roman Feiman](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman){:target="_blank"}, as well as a [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}. I received my B.S. in Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Philosophy from the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

Since August 2021, I have been working in the [CoCoSci Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}  with [Max Siegel](http://web.mit.edu/maxs/www/){:target="_blank"}, [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"}, and [Tobi Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"} researching conceptual reasoning within probabilistic programs and large language models. Before that, I worked with [David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} researching individual differences in causal learning and building models of causal inference learning ([see our cogsci paper!](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_causallearning_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

Broadly, I conduct research at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Currently, I have been very interested in the computational mechanisms of human question asking. How can we create computational models that form questions as flexibly and easily as humans do? And can questions provide insights into how humans change their world models? 

<!-- I would like to work towards discovering unified theories of intelligence to create computational models that think and learn the way humans do.  -->

I am motivated to obtain a PhD not only to further our understanding of the human mind, but also to encourage other first-generation, Hispanic female students to pursue careers in STEM. My experience as a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnair.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the mentorship I have received, has inspired me to reinvest into my community through holding executive positions in the AI Club (AI@UCF) and Cognitive Sciences Club at UCF. As a leader in these clubs, I strive to create a space where other young scientists, no matter their background, can feel encouraged and supported to fulfill their aspirations. -->

On my free time, I enjoy playing pickleball, salsa dancing, [hiking/backpacking](https://lailacj.github.io/blog/hikes/), film photography, and going to jazz concerts. I also enjoy spending too much money on vinyl and buying more books than I could ever read (currently reading A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara).
