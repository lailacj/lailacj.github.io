My name is Laila Johnston (she/her). I am a [Cognitive Science PhD](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/home){:target="_blank"} Student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/){:target="_blank"}advised by [Roman Feiman](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/roman-feiman){:target="_blank"} and working with [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/){:target="_blank"}. I received my B.S. in Mathematics with minors in Computer Science and Philosophy from the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- as well as a [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}.  -->

Before starting my PhD, I worked in the [CoCoSci Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}  with [Max Siegel](http://web.mit.edu/maxs/www/){:target="_blank"}, [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh){:target="_blank"}, and [Tobi Gerstenberg](https://cicl.stanford.edu/member/tobias_gerstenberg/){:target="_blank"} researching conceptual reasoning in the domain of tug-of-war games within probabilistic programs and large language models. Before that, I worked with [David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} researching individual differences in causal learning and building models of causal inference learning ([see our cogsci paper!](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_causallearning_2021.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

My research centers around understanding the computational mechanisms of how humans use ad-hoc contextual information to determine what is revelant (i.e. the frame problem). Currently, I am researching how people generate linguistic alternatives and what computational process can explain which alternatives enrich the meaning of an utterance. I am also very interested in the mechanisms of human question asking. How can we create models that form questions as flexibly and easily as humans do? And can questions provide insights into how humans change their world models? ([see my NSF GRFP research proposal for more details](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_NSFGRFP_ResearchProposal_2022.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

<!-- Broadly, I conduct research at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and philosophy. I would like to work towards discovering unified theories of intelligence to create computational models that think and learn the way humans do.  -->

I am motivated to obtain a PhD not only to further our understanding of the human mind, but also to encourage other first-generation, Hispanic female students to pursue careers in STEM. My experience as a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnair.ucf.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the mentorship I have received, has inspired me to reinvest into my community through holding executive positions in the AI Club (AI@UCF) and Cognitive Sciences Club at UCF. As a leader in these clubs, I strive to create a space where other young scientists, no matter their background, can feel encouraged and supported to fulfill their aspirations. -->

On my free time, I enjoy playing pickleball, salsa dancing, [hiking/backpacking](https://lailacj.github.io/blog/hikes/), film photography, and going to jazz concerts. I also enjoy spending too much money on vinyl and buying more books than I could ever read.
