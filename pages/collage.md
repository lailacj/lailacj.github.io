*in 11th grade (2016) i took a film photography class. one of the first assignments was to create a collage on a folder that would hold all our future photographs. this was the first time i ever created a collage. i greatly enjoyed the process of flipping through magazines, finding cool images, and then figuring out a way to make them all connect. this art piece is by far my favorite creation i have ever done.*
