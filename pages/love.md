[Irving Singer, *Philosophy of Love: A Partial Summing-Up*](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_reflection_philolove.pdf)<br>
"Then there is the underlying aesthetic dimension in life that is surely not reducible to the current parameters of traditional scientific investigation. The truthfulness of a great work of music, let’s say, is not the same as scientific truth, and yet one has to find out what it is about aesthetic truth that makes it so essential to the understanding of human existence."

[Søren Kierkegaard, *Works of Love*](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_reflection_worksoflove.pdf)<br>
“When it is a duty to love, neither is a test needed nor the insulting foolhardiness of wanting to test, because if love is higher than every test it has already more than passed the test... Testing is always related to possibility; there is always the possibility that what is being tested will not pass the test.”

[Jean-Luc Marion, *The Erotic Phenomenon*](https://lailacj.github.io/pdfs/papers/johnston_reflection_eroticphenomenon.pdf)<br>
“I only have the assurance that I am loving, for as long as I am loving – that is to say that I assume the risk of loving first; I only have the initiative insofar as I can love, and can make a primary decision to love without return, and can make it so that love, through me, loves.”
